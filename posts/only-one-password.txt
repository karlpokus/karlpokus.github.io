# one password for all things

Secure passwords are important to keep your stuff safe but hard to remember - especially if you need more than one. Apps like [1password](https://1password.com/) and [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) helps you manage this mess by storing them behind a master password. All you need to remember is *one* password. 1pw is really user friendly and simple to sync across multiple devices. Pass follows the unix philosophy and allows for greater flexibility.

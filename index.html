<p>Secure passwords are important to keep your stuff safe but hard to remember - especially if you need more than one. Apps like <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a> and <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> helps you manage this mess by storing them behind a master password. All you need to remember is <em>one</em> password. 1pw is really user friendly and simple to sync across multiple devices. Pass follows the unix philosophy and allows for greater flexibility.</p>

<h1 id="automatic-agenda-company-weekly-meeting">automatic agenda @company weekly meeting</h1>
<p>Assuming the company uses Trello for project management, prior to the weekly meeting - each team member adds a common label (like #meeting) to cards in any company board. Once at weekly meeting, use <a href="http://codepen.io/KarlPokus/debug/a1d690fc435a466bbf3637ac65ec193c">tragenda</a> to search for cards by label. Voila! We have an agenda.</p>
<p>usage @meeting</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize by re-ordering cards</li>
<li>Click a card to open it in Trello (also marks the card as done - this does not alter any data in Trello)</li>
<li>A progressbar shows how many cards are left</li>
</ul>
<p>Works on mobile devices. Repo at <a href="https://github.com/karlpokus/tragenda">github</a></p>

<p>Automating certain behaviors by performing other behaviors. <a href="http://www.bfskinner.org">Skinner</a> was a master at this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred seemed to dispose of envelopes and junk mail in an especially efficient way/.../When he opened his mail in the morning, he usually positioned his chair and trash can so that the very slightest flick of his wrist did the job. This was no accident, and it was part of the reason he was able to reply to virtually every letter he ever received, even until the end.</p>

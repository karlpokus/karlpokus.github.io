<p>Automating certain behaviors by performing other behaviors. <a href="http://www.bfskinner.org">Skinner</a> was a master at this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred seemed to dispose of envelopes and junk mail in an especially efficient way/.../When he opened his mail in the morning, he usually positioned his chair and trash can so that the very slightest flick of his wrist did the job. This was no accident, and it was part of the reason he was able to reply to virtually every letter he ever received, even until the end.</p>

<h1 id="automatic-agenda-company-weekly-meeting">automatic agenda @company weekly meeting</h1>
<p>Assuming the company uses Trello for project management, prior to the weekly meeting - each team member adds a common label (like #meeting) to cards in any company board. Once at weekly meeting, use <a href="http://codepen.io/KarlPokus/debug/a1d690fc435a466bbf3637ac65ec193c">tragenda</a> to search for cards by label. Voila! We have an agenda.</p>
<p>usage @meeting</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize by re-ordering cards</li>
<li>Click a card to open it in Trello (also marks the card as done - this does not alter any data in Trello)</li>
<li>A progressbar shows how many cards are left</li>
</ul>
<p>Works on mobile devices. Repo at <a href="https://github.com/karlpokus/tragenda">github</a></p>
